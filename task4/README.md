# Node.js Global Mentoring Program - Module 4 Testing

Link to [ebook](https://ebook.learn.epam.com/node-gmp/docs/testing/Homework).

## Getting started

1. Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Implement the task


## Practical task

You are working for a delivery company that has offices in Great Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands. You are a part of backend team that focuses on building internal tools for that company. One day you received a new request from a customer to create a public holidays module. This module will:

- show a list of public holidays for specific country for the current year
- show the next public holiday for specific country
- show if today is public holiday in your location

After some time of investigation, you found [Nager.Date API](https://date.nager.at/swagger/index.html) that meets the requirements above. Your customer agreed to use it, so now you can start the development.

Once youâ€™ve finished writing code, you have to cover your module with tests. The implementation can in this repository.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Jest is used for unit and integration tests, supertest - for E2E tests.
2. The module is covered with tests following instructions below:
   - Unit tests are written for public-holidays.service.ts and helpers.ts files. Keep in mind that any external calls are mocked in unit tests.
   - Integration tests are written for public-holidays.service.ts. Do not forget that in this case you make real calls to the API.
   - E2E tests are written for any two endpoints from Nager.Date API.
3. Code coverage is calculated, it is not less than 85%.
   - the `npm coverage` script is added to calculate the coverage.
   - Coverage Reporter[https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#coveragereporters-arraystring--string-options] is cobertura: --coverageReporters=cobertura
   - Coverage directory(https://jestjs.io/docs/cli#--coveragedirectorypath) is a root directoty of the project: --coverageDirectory=.

   Script example: `jest --coverage --coverageReporters=cobertura --coverageDirectory=. --testPathPattern='.*\\.test\\.ts'`
4. The following npm scripts are added to run tests:
   - `npm test:unit` - to run unit tests
   - `npm test:integration` - to run integration tests
   - `npm test:e2e` - to run E2E tests

Note: npm script: `npm test`  should not be used as it is reserved for running internal tests on Autocode
